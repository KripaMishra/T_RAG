    "answer": "The major obstacles for output generation on the semantic level include:\n\n- **Ambiguity and vagueness:** The semantic space is vast and complex, making it challenging to define clear and concise concepts.\n- **Context dependence:** The meaning of a term can vary depending on the context in which it is used.\n- **Limited knowledge representation:** Current knowledge representations may not be comprehensive enough to capture all the nuances of human language.\n- **Computational complexity:** Generating high-quality output at the semantic level can be computationally expensive."
