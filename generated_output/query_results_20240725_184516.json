    "answer": "**Major obstacles for output generation on the semantic level include:**\n\n- **Ambiguity and vagueness:** The semantic space is vast and often lacks clear definitions, leading to difficulties in generating coherent and accurate output.\n- **Context dependence:** Understanding the context and relationships between entities is crucial for generating relevant and meaningful output.\n- **Limited knowledge representation:** Current language models have limited knowledge of the world, making it challenging to generate output that is comprehensive and factual.\n- **Noise and"
