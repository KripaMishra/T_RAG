    "answer": "To answer the query about the major hurdles for the output generation of semantic level, we first define the following hurdles:\nThe main hurdle for the generation of accurate results is the lack of efficient and accurate way of processing large corpus. However, this problem can be overcome by using symbolic processing engines, such as ProLog, which can process large corpus of documents with high efficiency.\nThe second hurdle is the problem of verifying the correctness of the logic. The problem of verifi- cation can be solved using standard tools, such the Boolean logic and Prolog.\nFinally, the third hurdle is that of proving the validity of the inference engine. The verification can be done using the standard tools Prolog and Boolean logic.\nIn the process of solving the above-mentioned hurdles, we find the following solutions:\n1. Use a symbolic engine.\n2. Use the Standard tools ProLog and Boolean Logic to verify the correctness and efficiency of the engine. This solution is the most efficient",
